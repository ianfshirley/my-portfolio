      "description": "I’m Ian F. Shirley, a software developer & designer with a background in sales, customer service & fraud investigation. I love designing, building, and fixing things, and I'm obsessed with finding answers to the questions “how” and “why”. I’m very analytical, and motivated to find solutions to the problems I encounter, and I disagree with the phrase “if it ain’t broke, don’t try to fix it”, because I think there’s usually a way to improve on something even if it’s already working. In short, I like to find ways to maximize efficiency.  All of these things make this a rewarding career for me;  and on top of that, I hope that someday I can use those skills and attributes at a company that makes positive contributions to issues that I care about, such as homelessness or environmental sustainability.",

On the gameplay page, the user attempts to shoot the target using the crosshair cursor while the bird is animated to fly randomly around the gameplay area. We also made use of local storage to be able to save previous players' scores to the leaderboard page. The scoreboard on the gameplay screen updates the current user's score and level in real time.",
