      "description": "I’m Ian F. Shirley, a software developer & designer with a background in sales, customer service & fraud investigation. I love designing, building, and fixing things, and I'm obsessed with finding answers to the questions “how” and “why”. I’m very analytical, and motivated to find solutions to the problems I encounter, and I disagree with the phrase “if it ain’t broke, don’t try to fix it”, because I think there’s usually a way to improve on something even if it’s already working. In short, I like to find ways to maximize efficiency.  All of these things make this a rewarding career for me;  and on top of that, I hope that someday I can use those skills and attributes at a company that makes positive contributions to issues that I care about, such as homelessness or environmental sustainability.",
